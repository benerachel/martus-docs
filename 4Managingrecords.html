                                    <h3>Default views and folders</h3>
                                    <p>Martus automatically includes three permanent views: All, Saved, and Received. 
                                    (These default labels are different from some earlier versions of Martus. If you upgrade from a version earlier than Martus 5.0, your old labels will automatically be migrated to this new folder structure, so your records will not be lost.)</p>
                                    <p><b>All</b></p>
                                        <p>All records on your local machine will be listed under the All view.</p>
                                    <p><b>Saved</b></p>
                                        <p>The Saved view contains all records that you have saved, whether they are versioned or not or shared with contacts, and whether they have been sent to the server or not.</p>
                                    <p><b>Received</b></p>
                                        <p>This view contains records you’ve received from another Martus user. These records are included in searches and you can copy or move them to different folders. </p>
                                    <p>An <b>Imported Records</b> folder will be created if you load any records into Martus using the Import Record icon <img src="import.png"> in the Martus sidebar.</p>
                                    <h3>Create New Folders</h3>
                                    <p>Create additional folders to categorize records according to your interests or current projects.</p>
                                    <ol class="list">

                                        <li>Select the Add icon <img src="addfolder.png"> from the Martus sidebar.</li>

                                        <li>Input a name for the new folder.</li>
                                        <li>Select Create.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <h3>Rename Folders</h3>
                                    <ol class="list">
                                        <li>Double-click the folder you would like to rename.</li>
                                        <li>Input a new name for the folder.</li>
                                        <li>Select Rename.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>Note: You cannot use punctuation in a folder name, but you can include spaces. You can also use characters from non-Latin alphabets, such as Arabic or Russian.</p>
                                    <p>You can’t rename permanent views such as All, Saved, and Received.</p>
                                    <p>You can rename the Imported Records folder, however Martus will create a new Imported Records folder the next time you import data into Martus.</p>
                                    <h3>Delete Folders</h3>
                                    <p>Deleting a folder removes the folder and moves all records under that label to the Trash.</p>
                                    <ol class="list">
                                        <li>Select the folder you would like to remove.</li>
                                        <li>Select the Delete icon <img src="delete.png"> from the Martus sidebar.</li>
                                        <li>Read the informational text.</li>
                                        <li>Select Delete to confirm deletion.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <h3>Move records</h3>
                                    <ol class="list">                                   
                                        <li>Select the records that you would like to move.</li>
                                        <li>Select the Move icon <img src="move.png"> in the taskbar below the main list pane.</li>
                                        <li>Select the folder under which you would like the record to be moved.</li>
                                        <li>Uncheck <i>Remove from…</i> to keep the record(s) listed under multiple folders.</li>
                                        <p>Note: The multiple listings will still be considered one record.</p>
                                        <li>Select Move.
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>Note: You may also create a new folder in which to save your search results using the Add icon <img src="addfolder.png"> in the Martus sidebar and then following the above directions after performing a search.</p>
                                    <h3>Copy a record</h3>
                                    <p>Unlike moving a record, copying a record creates a new record based on the original. The new record must be renamed to differentiate it from the original.</p>
                                        <ol class="list">
                                        <li>Select the record that you would like to make a copy.</li>
                                        <p>Note: Only one record can be copied at a time.</p>
                                        <li>Select the Copy icon <img src="coopy.png"> in the taskbar below the main list pane.</li>
                                        <li>Enter a new name for the copy of the record.</li>
                                        <li>Uncheck <i>Remove from Existing?</i> to keep the record(s) under multiple folders.</li>
                                        <li>Select Copy.</li>

                                     <p>Deleting a record from a folder does not delete the record from your local device or the server. The record moves to the Trash, located in the Martus sidebar where it can still be viewed or moved, but not edited.</p>
                                    <ol class="list">
                                    <li>Select the record you would like to delete.</li>
                                    <li>Select the Delete icon <img src="delete.png"> in the taskbar below the main list pane.</li>

                                    <h3>Delete Records from your Hard Drive</h3>
                                    <p>Once you delete a record from your hard drive, you cannot retrieve it unless it is stored on the server.</p>
                                    <ol class="list">
                                    <li>Select the Trash icon <img src="trash.png"> from the Martus sidebar.</li>
                                    <li>Review the records listed in the Trash to be sure you do not accidentally delete important records.</li>
                                    <li>Select Empty Trash.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>You do not need to do anything further to ensure that deleted records are removed from your hard drive. Unlike most computer data, Martus records are encrypted files on your hard drive—including your own records, records created by other people, and deleted records. Therefore, unless someone gains access to your Martus account, they cannot read the records you store in your folders or the records you’ve deleted. </p>

                                    <p>If you have a very large file to import, or your import has a lot of special characters in it (e.g. < > ' " ) you may receive import errors. If the size of the file is the issue, you can try splitting into smaller files. Please contact martus@benetech.org if you need help with any import issues.</p>

									<div id="Tor">
									<p>The Onion Router, or Tor, is software and an open network that provides anonymity and privacy protection over the internet. Tor routes an internet user’s traffic through a global network of relays in such a way as to obscure both the origin and the destination of the traffic. By bouncing your communications around a distributed network all around the world, Tor helps defend against a form of network surveillance known as traffic analysis. It will make sending records harder to track, but also much slower.</p>
									<p>WARNING: Before using Tor, please read the full list of warnings available at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download#warning">https://www.torproject.org/download/download#warning</a>. If you have any questions about what Tor does or does not do, or any other Tor-specific questions, email the Tor support team at help@rt.torproject.org. (For questions about Martus and Tor, email the Martus support team at martus@benetech.org)
                                    <h3>Tor Preferences</h3>
                                    <p>Using Tor will make it harder to track the route your record takes to the Martus server, and may allow you to reach the Martus server if it is blocked from your current location, but will also make sending and receiving records slower. For more information about Tor, go to <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">https://www.torproject.org/</a> or see <a href="8Troubleshooting.html#q33">Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</p>
                                    <h3>Using Tor</h3>
                                    <p>Turn embedded Tor On and Off using the Tor switch <img src="Tor.png"> in the main Martus taskbar. Select Settings > Tor Preferences for more information about Tor.</p>
